When the app opens, a enter location view controller is presented. When you enter a string, it geocodes the address and presents you the weather of the location. 
<br>
On the Weather Page, you have two buttons on top left and top right. On top right, settings button is there, which can be used to trigger dark mode on and off. <br>
On top left, add button is there. It has a table view which stores all the previous searched locations using Realm. You can edit the locations by deleting the row by swiping the row. Also, when the row is clicked, it refreshed the app and makes it the default weather location. <br>
