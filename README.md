# SnowMan
Snowman is a minimalist weather app written in Swift 4. This project is also the capstone project for Udacity's Nanodegree Project. The app starts with a screen which shows you current weather, along with 10 day forecast. On the top right, it has a settings button which enables and disable a dark mode theme in the app. If the Internet Connection is not available, the data is set using the most recent object saved in the Realm Database.
